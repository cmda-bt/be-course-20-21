# Week 8

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
> having to look at its code.
> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

> _This week your **team assessment (A2)** will take place. There is no new theory. You can continue working on your matching application and topics_.

## Assessment

Based on your repository, source code and live version you show what you contributed to the team project for back-end. The idea is not to present your feature, **a teacher will look through the code and ask questions**. By answering questions you demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals. _This is an individual test, so they will be conducted between one teacher and one student._

Make sure you hand-in your work in the assignments `a2` slot on Brightspace.
* A link to your _team repository_
* A direct link to your _wiki_
